Hey, this project is just a quick demo for testing browsers (and servers) if they're able to work with Faye for giving your webapp a little real-time spice like live chatting and so on.  

To Run

On the server:

1)  Install prerequisite gems
$  gem install faye
$  gem install eventmachine
(You may need to build a Gemfile and do $  bundle install --path vendor/bundle  if you're on a shared host.  Then $  bundle exec ruby server.rb  to get things to work out for you.)

2)  Run $  ruby server.rb

3)  run $  ruby client.rb

4)  Spawn a webserver such as  $  python -m SimpleHTTPServer


On the client:  

1)  Browser to http://your-server:8000/main.html



After all that's done with, you should be seeing alert message boxes popping up on your client web browser.  This means your server is running properly, and your server-side client (client.rb) is running properly.  Client.rb acts very much as a server in this scenario, btw, so appologies for any confusion there.  If you shutdown client.rb, it will stop sending those messages to the client.  Then start it back up, and you'll get more of those pesky alert messages.  

You can get a better feel for things by reading from http://faye.jcoglan.com
